Introduction

Hello all! Michael Grantham here. I am a first year PhD hopeful. I grew up in south Lincoln and attended UNL for my undergraduate degree, which was a math degree with a stats focus. 

One of my interests is basketball and sports more broadly, so I'm interested in finding ways to analyze sports performance in such a way so as to maximize both player and team objectives--meaning, find and prioritize training and gameplay strategies to maximize output.

Another of my interests is finance. I'd like to find a way to do a little better than the market. In particular I'm interested in value investing because I see it as a way both to increase my holdings while helping the market behave more efficiently. 

In my free time, I like to exercise. My favorite activities are basketball, weight training, and jump training, though I will do really anything physical and fun as long as it doesn't interfere with my training objectives.

I look forward to working with you all this semester!
